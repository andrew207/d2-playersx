# d2-playersx
displays playersx count in a console window for Diablo 2 players. 

App manifest forces running as admin, code includes upping of privilege to grant SeDebugPrivilege required for ReadProcessMemory.

App simply checks the value in memory and prints it to the screen every second.

This is just a PoC that probably should be implemented into D2Interface now that people are doing PlayersX speedruns.
